SELECT id, title, realise_year
FROM albums
WHERE title = 'Doolittle';
Challenge 1 - 
Find the titles of the albums released by 'Pixies' and released between 1980 and 1990

SELECT title 
FROM albums
WHERE artist_id = 1;

Challenge 2 - 
Delete the album with ID 12.

Use a SELECT query to get the list of albums and verify that one has been deleted.

DELETE FROM albums
WHERE id = '12';

SELECT * albums;

Challenge 3 - 
nsert a new artist of your choice, and a new album related to that artist (here's an idea, if you can't pick one).

Then run a SELECT query to check the new artist is now in the table.

INSERT INTO artists (name, genre)
VALUES ('Spice girls','Pop');

INSERT INTO albums (title, release_year, artist_id)
VALUES ('Spice up your life', 1997, (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name = 'Spice girls'));

SELECT * albums;
